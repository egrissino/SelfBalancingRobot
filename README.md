# SelfBalancingRobot
A simple implementation of a PID controller class for Arduino to control a two wheel self balancing robot.

## How to use:
1. Download zip or clone repository
2. Add all files into a folder named SelfBalance and open in the arduino software
3. Verify and upload code to the arduio (note: This is optimized for arduino uno (atmega328)

### NOTE! Any updates to the motor code should go in this branch!
